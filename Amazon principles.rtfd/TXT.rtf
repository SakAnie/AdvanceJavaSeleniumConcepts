\
\cf3 The most challenging task which you solved in your professional journey?\
=========================================================\cf2 \
\
- Very critical client intensive project which we had to deliver in upcoming 7 working days.\
- just it was time of the first wave, 2020 my lead & my other \cf4 peer fell sick due to COVID \cf2 & went on leave . No-one else in that team had context on that ongoing project except we 3.\
- I spoke to my manager about the same and fortunately he helped me by providing 1 tempo-ray resources. I took it as a challenge, stretched my hours & delicately gave him all the required KT in 2-3days . We 2 together were able to manage the project delivery within the stipulated timeline to the client. I got this appreciation from BPM,TPMS and other stakeholders for managing that emergency situation with good productivity.\
	after that incident, how i earned the trust of my manager, and since last year, he gave me one scrum team to manage . He felt i was reliable enough to take it up.\
I am reliable to help the team in emergency situations\

===========\
STAR(\
Situation- SIT release scheduled to happen in next 3 days by Thursday 5pm,\
 TASK- to test the fix & the combinely regress it with the feature which was already signed off by some other QA and demoed to TPM\
Action- I looked into actual TID values in the sandbox.  highlighted it to the right form by conduction call on the same day, go the story rectified by TPM getting confirmation from BOA representative the next day, Dev fixed and QA validated, thus save the team from a potential P2 critical issue saving its time and cost.\
\
Result:-\
We had 2 release in 2 days one new feature + bugfix\

RECENT TEHCNICHAL CHALLENGE?- LOG4J VULNERABILITY FOX 2.15.0- TO 2.16.0.\
\
LOG4J is basically a java library provided by Apache and which is open source.\
On Dec 11th evening, we discovered that 	Visa had appointed WHITEHAT/BLUE HAT hackers to find the vulnerbaility in our APIs and sicovered that  apis which hadnt had any release of the log4j version from past 1 year were at risk. it consititued about 95% of our microservers/apis. For my APIs, it was a Saturday/Sunday i think 11th-12th Dec, we updated the version & released it to prod on P0 basis!\
